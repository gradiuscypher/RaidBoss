# RaidBoss
An RPG Discord bot.

## Rough Ideas - To be organized and implemented later

### Current Ideas and tinkerings
* Can edit monster quotes by adding a `content` section to the send message
* Need a way to abstract building monsters via a JSON file
* Potential: complex logic can be contained in scripts which can be referenced by the JSON file

### Key Game Concepts
* Server-wide combat, big bosses, small enemies, complex interactions. More than just DPSing something down.
* Aggro mechanics
* Characters can multi-class based on their gear
* Crafting and item hoarding is a thing
* Higher level gear is mostly character crafted, there's a player market
* Crafted gear can hold a player's name on it

### Other ideas and concepts
* Use of reaction emojis for interaction of menus, combat, etc
* Indicate a player's health by changing their Discord nick name
* Healers can interact with their party in the same way that everyone interacts with monsters
* Players can go on solo adventures as well, either actively hunting for crafting items, or set up afk adventures
  * Active vs Passive gatherings will have different yields
* Combat encounters should be easy to script with some sort of text-based config file
